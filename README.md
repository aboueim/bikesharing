# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this project, I will create a Tableau story aimed to convince investors that bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a sound business model proposal. In doing so, I will utilize a dataset related to bike trips with details on bikes, bike-riders, and the other trip-related information and conduct a bike trip analysis.


 To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results: 

Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

## Summary: 

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
