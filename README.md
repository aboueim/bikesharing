# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this project, I will create a Tableau story aimed to convince investors that bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a sound business model proposal. In doing so, I will utilize a dataset related to bike trips with details on bikes, bike-riders, and the other trip-related information and conduct a bike trip analysis to support the proposal. As part of my analysis, first I will use Pandas to make changes to a column's (in the data set) datatype and create an updated data set. Next, I will complete several visualizations within Tableau to develop a story that explains how the available data backs the business proposal.

Comparing genders in terms of how females vs male vs unknown use bikesharing over the week, we can see that males and female almost follow a same use behavior per weekday and hour, although number of males using this service is much more the others.
