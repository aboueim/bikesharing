# Bikesharing
 
## Overview of the analysis: 
In this project, I will create a Tableau story aimed to convince investors that bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a sound business model proposal. In doing so, I will utilize a dataset related to bike trips with details on bikes, bike-riders, and the other trip-related information and conduct a bike trip analysis to support the proposal. As part of my analysis, first I will use Pandas to make changes to a column's (in the data set) datatype and create an updated data set. Next, I will complete several visualizations within Tableau to develop a story that explains how the available data backs the business proposal.

Comparing genders in terms of how females vs male vs unknown use bikesharing over the week, we can see that males and female almost follow a same use behavior per weekday and hour, although number of males using this service is much more the others. However, in the unknown group, it looks like that they mostly used bikesharing on weekeneds rather than during business days.

## Summary: 

According to the bikesharing data, it looks like that rides occur during almost all week days (with less frquency on Sundays). Specifically, the length of these rides are typically short (less than an hour with highest frequency at 5 minutes for male and 6 minutes for females) and majority of riders have subscriptions. Given that the peak times for bikesharing rides during business days are at early morning 7 to 9 am and in the evening from 5 to 7 pm, it looks bikesharing is primarily used for work-related trips in this region. Although males more often use bikesharing, but the ride pattern in terms of the day and time of use does not differ significantly. Therefore, perhaps both males and females use bikesharing for work-related trips but males account for larger portion of rides. Overall, the high frequency and consistent use of bikesharing over the weekdays in this region can be seen as an opportunity to grow this bussiness model to other similar regions.
